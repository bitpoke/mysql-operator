## [0.5.0] - 2021-10-06
### Added
 * Add `image` and `mysqlVersion` options to MysqlCluster chart. This bumps the chart version to `0.3.1`

   it triggers a `graceful-master-takeover-auto` command in Orchestrator. This is disabled by
   default, to enable it set `gracefulShutdown.enabled=true` in chart values or set the controller
   command argument `failover-before-shutdown` to `true`.

   different compressors/decompressors when backing up or restoring.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-06-17
### Added

 * Added a test suite for RunCloneCommand logic, along with a mock backup server.
 * Added checks for service availability when cloning.
 * Added "fail fast" logic when unexpected errors occur during cloning/download.
 * Added `dataDir` cleanup code so that interrupted cloning does not leave dataDir in an
   inconsistent state.
 * Added e2e test demonstrating cloning failure when PVC is removed and pod recreated.
 * Add `MetricsExporterExtraArgs` field on MySQLCluster resource that allows to specify command line
   arguments to pass to MySQL metrics exporter.
 * Allow using custom secret for app credentials in `mysql-cluster` chart.
 * Add `XbstreamExtraArgs` field on MySQLCluster resource that allows to specify extra command line
   arguments to xbstream.
 * Add `XtrabackupExtraArgs`, `XtrabackupPrepareExtraArgs`, `XtrabackupTargetDir` to parametrize
   xtrabackup.
 * Add `RcloneExtraArgs` to parametrize rclone command.
 * Add `InitFileExtraSQL` to insert custom init SQL queries that will be run at MySQL
   initialization.
 * Add `Volumes` and `VolumesMounts` in `.Spec.PodSpec` to allow the user specifying custom volume
   mounts.
 * Add `InitContainers` and `Containers` in `.Spec.PodSpec` to allow the user specifying custom containers.
 * Add `MetricsExporterResources` and `MySQLOperatorSidecarResrouces` in `.Spec.PodSpec` to allow
   the user specifying resources for thos sidecars containers.
 * Add command line flag to configure number of workers for orchestrator controller.
 * Add livenessProbe to controller
### Changed
 * [#422](https://github.com/presslabs/mysql-operator/pull/422) adds the `SidecarServerPort` to the
   `MasterService` and introduces one new service, HealthyReplicasService, so that we can try to
   clone from replicas first, then fall back to master.
 * Changed the connect timeout from the default of 30s to 5s so that an empty k8s service will not
   cause cloning attempts to hang unnecessarily for 30s.
 * Update documentation structure and formatting.
 * Update Orchestrator version to v3.1.4
 * Update orchestrator base image to `alpine:3.11`.
 * Update FailoverInProgress condition to false when both Replicas and ReadyNodes are 0.
 * Fall back to current master, not pod 0, when no healthy replicas found for backup candidate.
 * Change the `mysql-operator` chart to be helm v3 compatible while keeping backward compatibility.
 * Change logging: change `cluster` logging field to `key`; normalize logging and more details;
   output Stackdrive compatible format.
 * Decrease `MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY` interval from 10 to 1 second.
 * Deprecate `TmpfsSize` because can be handled using `ExtraVolumes` and `ExtraMySQLVolumesMounts`.
 * Update cron documentation
 * Set InnoDB buffer parameter: `innodb_buffer_pool_instances` to `min(resources.limit.cpu,
   floor(innodb_buffer_pool_size/1G))` (see #502)
 * Change default resource requests/limits for `sidecar` container: requested=10m/32Mi, limit=the same as `.spec.podSpec.resources.limit`
 * Change default resource requests/limits for `exporter` container: requested=10m/32Mi, limit=100m/128Mi
 * Change default resource requests/limits for `heartbeat` container: requested=10m/32Mi, limit=100m/64Mi
 * If [`extra_port`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/performance/threadpool.html#extra_port)
   is defined in the cluster spec, metrics exporter will use it to connect to MySQL providing that
   [`extra_max_connections`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/performance/threadpool.html#extra_max_connections)
   is larger than the default `1`. If MySQL server runs out of available connections, using `extra_port`
   allows the exporter to continue collecting MySQL metrics.
 * Change the default number of workers for orchestrator controller from 1 to 10.
