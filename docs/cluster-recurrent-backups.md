In the [Backups]({{< ref "./backups.md" >}}) section we take backups on demand. However, a cluster can be configured to take recurrent backups. Also, a cluster can be initialized from an existing backup.

To be able to store backups, the secret defined under `backupBucketSecretName` must contain the credentials needed to access the storage provider(e.g GCS, AWS, etc.)


### Setup recurrent backups for MySQL cluster

You need to set the `backupBucketURL` in the cluster spec as an URL like `s3://BUCKET_NAME`, and the secret with storage credentials (`backupSecretName`).

See the example below to configure a cluster that has recurrent backups that runs once per day at midnight. To schedule a backup set `backupSchedule` field that is under crontab format. For more details about CRON format can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron).

``` yaml
apiVersion: mysql.presslabs.org/v1alpha1
kind: MysqlCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  secretName: the-secret

  backupSchedule: "0 0 0 * * *"  # daily
  backupURL: gs://bucket_name/path/
  backupSecretName: backup-secret
```

Some crontab examples and their predefined schedulers:

| Entry         | Equivalent To          | Description                                |
