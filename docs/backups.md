Backups are stored on object storage services like S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

In order to be able to store a backup, the secret defined under `backupSecretName` must have
the credentials to store those backups. The backups are uploaded using [Rclone](https://rclone.org/). The contents of the secret are used to generate a rclone.conf in [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/presslabs/mysql-operator/blob/master/hack/docker/sidecar-entrypoint.sh#L5).

### Setup a backup on S3

You need to specify the `backupBucketURL` for the cluster to an URL like `s3://BUCKET_NAME`, and a secret.

Create a file named `example-backup-secret.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-backup-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: #
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: #
  # Optional, the AWS region to connect
  # AWS_REGION: us-east1
  # Optional, specify the storage class
  # AWS_STORAGE_CLASS: STANDARD
  # Optional, canned ACL to use
  # AWS_ACL:
  # Optional, the S3 provider to use (default: AWS)
  # S3_PROVIDER: AWS
  # Optional, the S3 endpoint to use (for when you use a different S3_PROVIDER)
  # S3_ENDPOINT:
```

Then run this command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-backup-secret.yaml
```

### Setup a backup to Google Cloud

You need to specify the `backupBucketURL` for the cluster to an URL like `gs://BUCKET_NAME`, and a secret.

Create a file named `example-backup-secret.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-backup-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY: #
  GCS_PROJECT_ID: #
```

Then run this command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-backup-secret.yaml
```

> ###### NOTE
>
> `GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY` and `GCS_PROJECT_ID` must be base64 encoded.

### Setup a backup to Google Drive

Create a [Google Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) and ensure it has access to a
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) (owned by the account or shared). Save the provided JSON file for future
reference.

To configure the backup you need to specify the `backupBucketURL` for the cluster to an URL like
`gd://FOLDER_NAME` and a secret.

Create a file named `example-backup-secret.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-backup-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID: #
  GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID: #
  GDRIVE_IMPERSONATOR: #
  GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: #
```

Then run this command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-backup-secret.yaml
```

In the above configuration `GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID` is a required numeric value identical to the `client_id` value in your
service account JSON.

The `GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is also required and must be set to the contents of your service account JSON.

Optionally you can set a `GDRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID` equal to the ID of a Google Drive folder the service account has
access to. This can come from the default account drive, or any other drive shared with the account. This will be
considered as the *root* folder for the backup.

To find out the ID of a folder, navigate to it in your browser and inspect the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1_8-KN2Ew-I4L54nSmenKapE_yfPs2As1` - here the ID of the folder is `1_8-KN2Ew-I4L54nSmenKapE_yfPs2As1`.

In some cases (if you get access denied errors) you might also need to *impersonate* as the service account user. To
do this set the `GDRIVE_IMPERSONATOR` to the value of `client_email` in your service account JSON.

### Setup a backup to Azure Blob Storage

You need to specify the `backupBucketURL` for the cluster to an URL like `azure://STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, and a secret.

Create a file named `example-backup-secret.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-backup-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  AZUREBLOB_ACCOUNT: #
  AZUREBLOB_KEY: #
```

Then run this command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-backup-secret.yaml
```

> ###### NOTE
>
> `AZUREBLOB_ACCOUNT` and `AZUREBLOB_KEY` must be base64 encoded.

### Requesting a backup

You need to create a file named `example-backup.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: mysql.presslabs.org/v1alpha1
kind: MysqlBackup
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-backup
spec:
  clusterName: my-cluster
```

Run the following command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-backup.yaml
```

You need to specify the `backupBucketURL` for the corresponding cluster to an URL like `gs://BUCKET_NAME` and `backupSecretName`.
Open the file named `example-cluster.yaml` and copy into it the following YAML code:

``` yaml
apiVersion: mysql.presslabs.org/v1alpha1
kind: MysqlCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 2
  secretName: my-secret
  backupSecretName: my-cluster-backup-secret
  backupURL: gs://pl-test-mysql-operator/
```

Then run the following command:

``` shell
$ kubectl apply -f example-cluster.yaml
```

### Listing all backups

``` shell
$ kubectl get mysqlbackup
```

``` shell
NAME                                  AGE
my-cluster-backup                     1m
my-cluster-auto-backup-20180402-1604  1d
```

### Checking the backup state:

``` shell
$ kubectl describe backup my-cluster-backup
```

``` shell
...
Status:
  Completed:  true
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2018-03-21T16:02:56Z
    Message:               
    Reason:                
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Complete
...
```
